# PVO1 (Plymale Virtual Organ, Opus #1)

The main part you see is the [Organ Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_console), which consists of:

* Four [manuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_(music))
* A [pedalboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_keyboard)
* Many pistons (the rows of buttons that are below the manuals)
* Four [expression pedals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_pedal)

This is implemented as a MIDI controller.

The pipe organ sounds themselves are generated by a computer, running virtual pipe organ software such as [jOrgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOrgan) or [Hauptwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptwerk).
