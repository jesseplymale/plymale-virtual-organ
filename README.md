# Plymale Virtual Organ

This repository consists of code and documentation for the creation of a virtual [pipe organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_organ).

## My Projects

* [My virtual pipe organ](docs/pvo1.md)

## Code

* [ansible](ansible/README.md)
    * Automation software used to set up the Rpi4 that I used for development.
* [teensy](teensy/README.md)
    * I used the [Teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html) microprocessor to power the system.

## Helpful Links

Needless to say, internet resources were crucial in the design of this project. For the benefit of others who try similar projects, I have tried to organize a [collection of helpful links for virtual pipe organ construction](docs/links.md).
